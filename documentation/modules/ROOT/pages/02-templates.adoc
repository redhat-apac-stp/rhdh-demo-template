Click on `Create...` in the sidebar menu. *CHOOSE* the _Angular Single Page Application (SPA) for Points of Interest (POI) Map_ template.

In the second section of the template create form, type or paste your Project/namespace name into the _Namespace_ field.  In the Owner input, enter "user:USERNAME" where "USERNAME" is your own github username.  The result should be something like "user:ryanj".

Recall from chapter 1 that some Backstage forms refer to a Namespace that is equivalent to your OpenShift Project.

Review your configuration, making sure that your own Project name is listed. Note that the _Owner_ name may include a `default` prefix in the summary, like `user:default/projectname`. This represents Backstage's `default` user grouping. Click `CREATE` to deploy your frontend component.

[#github]
== View the source

Explore the repository Backstage created for you with the frontend component source code. Each scaffolded repo is part of the GitHub Org used in this workshop. Each one is prefixed with your Project/namespace name, giving your frontend component's source code repository a qualified name like github.com/Summit23JanusN/_NAMESPACE_-frontend.
