Open the provided web console url in your browser to connect to the openshift web console. Choose the "Login with Github" option to proceed.

[#project_access]
=== Project Access

Establish a project namespace for your work. 

Select "create a new project" from the main openshift page.  The project name must be unique. Enter your github username in the first two inputs, then click "Create".

Remember this project name!  You will need to enter it into several template inputs as your "Namespace" value.

In the next section, we will learn how to populate this project namespace with fresh content from the Backstage catalog. But first, the final step in this section involves connecting to our instance of Backstage.

[#backstage_access]
== Login to Backstage

Click on the app launcher link in the header menu and select "Backstage" to connect to your backstage instance.  

You will be prompted to authenticate.  Use the GitHub signin option.

Now that we have a project namespace and a successful connection to backstage, we can start to create our workloads using the template system.
