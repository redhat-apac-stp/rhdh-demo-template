[#devspaces]
== Introducing DevSpaces

While there are many ways to craft a Golden Path for your development staff, the option to include OpenShift DevSpaces provides a quick path to success with zero laptop installation effort.

In this chapter you will use DevSpaces to introduce a new API endpoint on your Gateway component.  The goal will be to add a custom datapoint to the "Red Hat Summit POI" dataset, which is stored in-memory within the Gateway component.

[#gateway_update]
== Use DevSpaces to update the Gateway
Enter your <NAMESPACE> into the search input of the Software Catalog to find your Gateway component entity

Open `/src/main/java/com/rhdevelopers/summit/workshop/SummitBackendResource.java`

Uncomment the following code block near the bottom of the file:

[.console-input]
[source,java,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
    @POST
    @Path("poi/add/point")
    public Response loadCustomPoi(PoiRecord record) {
        SUMMIT_POI_RECORDS.add(record);
        return Response.created(
            UriBuilder.fromPath("fake/poi/find/"+(SUMMIT_POI_RECORDS.size()-1)).build()
        ).entity("inserted custom data point").build();
    }

Use the following curl command to test the new API endpoint:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/fake/poi/add/point/' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
"name":"Milano, Italy",
"description":"example city",
"coordinates":[45.464203,9.189982]
}'

Reload the map to look for your new Point.
